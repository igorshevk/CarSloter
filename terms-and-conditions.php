                <p style="text-align: justify;">5.1.4 Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that any sale of any Vehicle by CarSloter Europe to any member of the Buyer Community is dependent on Seller agreeing to sell the Vehicle to CarSloter Europe, and that submission of the best Buyer Community Offer does not guarantee that Buyer will be able to purchase the Vehicle.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.1 CarSloter Europe Sale Confirmation</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.1.1 If (i) Buyer's Offer is deemed to be the best Buyer Community Offer in accordance with clause 6.1.3, (ii) CarSloter Europe is able to purchase the Vehicle(s) concerned from Seller and (iii) CarSloter Europe decides to accept such Offer in accordance with clause 5.1.3, CarSloter Europe sells the Vehicle(s) concerned to Buyer ("CarSloter Europe Sale"). The Vehicle(s) shall be sold at the Offered Price, to be increased with the Auction Fees, Country Fees, Transport Fees and all applicable Taxes .</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.1.2 In such case, CarSloter Europe will inform Buyer of the CarSloter Europe Sale, and Buyer is required to confirm via the Platform the administrative delivery details of the CarSloter Europe Sale within twenty-four (24) hours (one business day) as from receipt of such information from CarSloter Europe ("CarSloter Europe Sale Confirmation"). Buyer expressly acknowledges and agrees that the CarSloter Europe Sale Confirmation is an administrative formality to organise delivery and shall not be construed as a possibility for Buyer to cancel its Offer and/or otherwise cancel the CarSloter Europe Sale.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.1.3 In the CarSloter Europe Sale Confirmation, Buyer shall confirm in any case the country of destination of the purchased Vehicle(s).

                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.2.1 For each CarSloter Europe Sale, the Offered Price will be increased with all Taxes which shall be payable by Buyer. The Taxes will include the VAT due, if any, in the country of residence of the member of the CarSloter Europe invoicing the CarSloter Europe Sale. In case of an Intra-Community Supply or Export, and as far as there is sufficient Evidence of the transport of the Vehicle, no VAT will be due on the CarSloter Europe Sale and Buyer will be liable to account for the VAT due in the country of destination.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Unless the Vehicle is at the time of the sale located in Belgium, the Intra-Community Supplies are treated for VAT purposes as a “Triangulation Scheme” (cf. so-called ABC transactions). This implies that the Buyer shall take care, in the EU Member State of arrival, of the required VAT formalities as the last link in the chain (cf. party C).</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">6.2.2 At the time CarSloter Europe informs Buyer of the CarSloter Europe Sale under clause 6.1.2, CarSloter Europe will provide Buyer with an order form, which sets out (i) the Purchase Price, consisting of the Offered Price, the Auction Fees, the Country Fees, the Transport Fees and any applicable Taxes; and (ii) any guarantee payable by Buyer pursuant to clause 7.4.2.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">8.2 Buyer acknowledges and accepts that CarSloter Europe's commercially advantageous offerings regarding the Platform and the related services render it impossible for CarSloter Europe to carry out a detailed technical inspection of every Vehicle advertised by a Seller on the Platform, and to assume responsibility in that respect. Buyer acknowledges and accepts that all Vehicle Information is based on the information obtained from the Seller.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">To the maximum extent permitted by law, without prejudice to clause 9, and save in case of its own fraud or wilful intent, CarSloter Europe shall not be responsible for, and not be liable for any Losses suffered or incurred by Buyer arising out of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or incompleteness of the Vehicle Information (including without limitation in relation to mileage, damage, technical faults, optional extras, colour, year of manufacture, date of first registration, etc.).</p>

                <br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">16.1 CarSloter Europe registers access to and use of the Platform. This access and use log provides evidence that access has been gained to and use has been made of the Platform, unless Buyer can prove the contrary. Electronic messages, connections, operations on the network and transactions between CarSloter Europe and Buyer shall be proven using the logs and transaction files kept electronically by CarSloter Europe. Buyer accepts the evidential value of this data. This capability of proof does not prevent the Parties from each providing their own proof using permitted legal methods.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">16.2 Neither Party shall be responsible for any damage caused by the non-compliance or delay in compliance of obligations resulting from a case of force majeure, external cause or any other events which are not under the reasonable control of CarSloter Europe.</p>

                <p style="text-align: justify;">16.6 Those clauses that by their nature are expressly or implicitly intended to survive the termination or expiry of these Terms and Conditions, shall so survive, including but not limited to clauses 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 16.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">16.7 If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is finally determined to be, or becomes, invalid, illegal or unenforceable, then such provision shall, if possible, and insofar as such clause is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, be replaced by the Parties by a valid, legal and enforceable clause reflecting as close as possible the initial intentions. If the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision cannot be validly replaced, then no effect shall be given to said clause and it shall be deemed not to be included in these Terms and Conditions, such without affecting or invalidating the remaining provisions of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
